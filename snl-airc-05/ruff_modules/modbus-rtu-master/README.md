Please reference [Modbus Application Protocol](www.modbus.org/docs/Modbus_Application_Protocol_V1_1b3.pdf) for more information.

## Usage

Here is the basic usage of this module.

```js
var ModbusRtuMaster = require('modbus-rtu-master');
rs485 = $('#rs485');
var modbus = new ModbusRtuMaster(rs485);
var slaveAddress = 0x01;
var startAddress = 0x03e8;
var quantity = 8;
modbus.readHoldingRegisters(slaveAddress, startAddress, quantity, function (error, values) {
    if (error) {
        console.log('Error is', error);
        return;
    }
    console.log('data is', values);
});

```

## API References

### Methods

#### Class `ModbusRtuMaster(port, options)`
The constructor function.
- **port:** The communication port that modbus relies on, usually the port is an `UART`. The port must have one `write` method and can emit `data` event.
- **options:** Some configrations to parse data from the port using mobus protocol.
  - **cmdTimeout:** Optional. The command timeout of one modbus command. The default value is 500 milliseconds.
  - **parseSlaveData:** Optional. `parseSlaveData` is an boolean, when it is `true`, the response data will be converted to an readable `Array` format according the modbus protocol,
  otherwise, the response data will be in format of raw `Buffer`. The defalue vlaue is `true`.

#### `readCoils(slaveAddress, startAddress, quantity, callback)`
Function code 0x01, it is used to read from 1 to 2000 contiguous status of coils in a remote device.
- **slaveAddress:** The address of the remote device.
- **startAddress:** The starting address of coils to be read.
- **quantity:** The quantity of coils to be read.
- **callback:** The callback gets `error` and `states` as its arguments. The `states` is an array or buffer that contains the states of coils.

#### `readDiscreteInputs(slaveAddress, startAddress, quantity, callback)`
Function code 0x02, it is used to read from 1 to 2000 contiguous status of discrete inputs in a remote device.
- **slaveAddress:** The address of the remote device.
- **startAddress:** The starting address of discrete inputs to be read.
- **quantity:** The quantity of discrete inputs to be read.
- **callback:** The callback gets `error` and `states` as its arguments. The `states` is an array or buffer that contains the states of discrete inputs.

### `readHoldingRegisters(slaveAddress, startAddress, quantity, callback)`
Function code 0x03, it is used to read the contents of a contiguous block of holding registers in a remote device.
- **slaveAddress:** The address of the remote device.
- **startAddress:** The starting address of holding registers to be read.
- **quantity:** The quantity of holding registers to be read.
- **callback:** The callback gets `error` and `values` as its arguments. The `values` is an array or buffer that contains the values of holding registers.

### `readInputRegisters(slaveAddress, startAddress, quantity, callback)`
Function code 0x04, it is used to read from 1 to 125 contiguous input registers in a remote device.
- **slaveAddress:** The address of the remote device.
- **startAddress:** The starting address of input registers to be read.
- **quantity:** The quantity of input registers to be read.
- **callback:** The callback gets `error` and `values` as its arguments. The `values` is an array or buffer that contains the values of input registers.

### `writeSingleCoil(slaveAddress, address, state, callback)`
Function code 0x05, it is used to write a single output to either `ON` or `OFF` in a remote device.
- **slaveAddress:** The address of the remote device.
- **address:** The address of coil to be forced to `ON` or `OFF` state.
- **state:** The `ON` or `OFF` state, `1` means `ON` and `0` means `OFF`.
- **callback:** The callback gets `error` and `state` as its arguments. The `state` is the parameter `state` to be written.

### `writeSingleRegister(slaveAddress, address, value, callback)`
Function code 0x06, it is used to write a single holding register in a remote device.
- **slaveAddress:** The address of the remote device.
- **address:** The address of the holding register to be written.
- **value:** The value to be set to the holding register.
- **callback:** The callback gets `error` and `value` as its arguments. The `value` is the parameter `value` to be written.

### `writeMultipleCoils(slaveAddress, startAddress, states, callback)`
Function code 0x0F, it is used to force each coil in a sequence of coils to either `ON` or `OFF` in a remote device.
- **slaveAddress:** The address of the remote device.
- **startAddress:** The starting address of the coils to be written to.
- **states:** The states to be written to the coils. The `states` is an array with `1` or `0` as its element, here `1` means `ON` and `0` means `OFF`.
- **callback:** The callback gets `error` and `quantity` as its arguments. The `quantity` is the length of `states` to be written.

### `writeMultipleRegisters(slaveAddress, startAddress, values, callback)`
Function code 0x10, it is used to write a block of contiguous registers (1 to 123 registers) in a remote device.
- **slaveAddress:** The address of the remote device.
- **startAddress:** The starting address of the registers to be written to.
- **values:** The values to be written to the registers. The `values` is an array with an two bytes value as its element.
- **callback:** The callback gets `error` and `quantity` as its arguments. The `quantity` is the length of `values` to be written.
